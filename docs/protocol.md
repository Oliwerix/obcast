# OBCast protocol — control plane & encoder↔server feedback loop

The Rust types in `crates/obcast-proto` are the source of truth for every schema
here. This document describes how they move on the wire. JSON is the encoding for
the control and link planes; media segments are raw bytes.

There are three planes:

| Plane   | Who               | Transport                                  |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Media   | encoder → server  | HTTP/2 segment uploads; HLS to listeners   |
| Link    | encoder ↔ server  | segment-response piggyback + SSE state feed |
| Control | web ↔ server      | REST + WebSocket                           |

The **link plane is the new heart of the system**: the server continuously tells
the encoder where playout is and where its buffer is thin, so the encoder can aim
bandwidth at the segments that will actually be played.

---

## 1. Why both ends share state

On a flaky uplink with the server draining its buffer, a naive "prefer high
quality" encoder will keep the pipe full of HD segments and starve the one
segment the server is about to play — causing a dropout. OBCast closes the loop:

- The server publishes [`ServerState`](../crates/obcast-proto/src/state.rs):
  playout head, the contiguous playable **frontier**, the **lead** (ms of audio
  ahead of the head), buffer **water levels**, and per-segment **coverage**
  (which rung it holds where).
- The encoder feeds that into [`plan_uploads`](../crates/obcast-proto/src/scheduler.rs),
  which decides, each tick, what to send. Priority is absolute:
  **continuity → live-edge → upgrade**, and upgrades are *only* scheduled ahead
  of the playout head so no bandwidth is wasted on segments already played.

If the feedback goes stale (link down), the encoder falls back to
`ServerState::unknown()` and behaves conservatively (low rung, protect the live
edge).

---

## 2. Media plane (encoder → server)

### Upload a segment
```
POST /ingest/{stream}/segment
Headers:
  X-Auth: <ingest token>
  X-Rendition: <rung id>          # 0 = survival rung
  X-Seq: <u64>                    # canonical clock; idempotent on (rung, seq)
  Content-Type: audio/mp2t
Body: <segment bytes>
```
Idempotent: re-POSTing the same `(rung, seq)` is safe (overwrite / no-op), which
makes retries and reconnect-resume trivial.

**Response body is a `ServerState` JSON** — every successful upload piggybacks
fresh feedback, so when the link works the encoder needs no extra round trips.

### Abandon segments
```
POST /ingest/{stream}/abandon      Body: { "seqs": [u64, ...] }
```
Tells the server to stop waiting on permanent gaps so playout can skip them.

---

## 3. Link plane (server → encoder)

### State feed (survives upload stalls)
```
GET /ingest/{stream}/state         # text/event-stream (SSE)
event: state
data: <ServerState JSON>
```
Pushed on every significant change and at least every ~1 s. Small enough to
survive a thin link even when segment uploads are failing. The encoder always
uses the **highest `rev`** it has seen and ignores older ones.

### Encoder telemetry (for operator dashboards)
```
POST /ingest/{stream}/heartbeat    Body: <EncoderState JSON>
Header: X-Auth: <ingest token>   (only if OBCAST_INGEST_TOKEN is set)
```
Sent by the encoder client once a second regardless of whether an upload
happened that tick, so telemetry (current rung, throughput, backlog, locally
abandoned seqs) stays fresh even while idling in survival mode with nothing
new to send. The server stores the latest snapshot per stream and surfaces it
as `ControlStatus.encoder` and real `LinkHealth.throughput_kbps` (§4) — purely
additive dashboard data. It never feeds back into `plan_uploads`; the
upload-scheduling loop (§1) runs entirely off `ServerState`, piggybacked on
uploads and the SSE feed above.

### `ServerState` fields that drive the scheduler
- `playout.state` + `playout.position_seq` — the anchor for all urgency.
- `frontier_seq` — highest seq contiguously playable from the anchor.
- `lead_ms` — ms of contiguous audio ahead of the head (drain indicator).
- `water` = `{ low_ms, target_ms, high_ms }` — survival / target / upgrade gates.
- `coverage[]` — best rung per seq for a bounded window ahead of the anchor, so
  the encoder sees exactly where HD is missing without guessing.

## 4. Control plane (web ↔ server)

Every control-plane route is per-stream, matching the media and link planes.
`set_device` is accepted by the schema but not implemented yet — playout
always uses the host's default audio output; requesting it returns
`501 Not Implemented`.

### Status snapshot
```
GET /api/{stream}/status  ->  ControlStatus { stream, server, encoder?, link }
```
`status`, `waveform`, and `ws` are read-only: unlike ingest (which starts a
new stream on first upload) they never spin up a stream that's never been
ingested into. A name with no in-memory handle and no on-disk show directory
returns `404`, rather than silently creating an empty one — see CLAUDE.md §8
"per-stream resource leak".

### Playout commands
```
POST /api/{stream}/playout   Body: <PlayoutCommand JSON>
Header: X-Auth: <control token>   (only if OBCAST_CONTROL_TOKEN is set on the server)
```
Deliberately a separate credential from ingest's `X-Auth` token (§2) — an OB
site's upload credential shouldn't also be able to stop/seek/set-volume the
server's hardware output. Unset `OBCAST_CONTROL_TOKEN` (the default) disables
this check, same "no token configured = auth disabled" semantics as ingest.
A missing/incorrect header is rejected with `401 Unauthorized`.

`PlayoutCommand` variants (tagged by `"cmd"`):

| cmd          | payload                          | effect                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `start`      | `{ position }`                   | start HW output ("on demand" start) |
| `stop`       | —                                | stop HW output                      |
| `pause`/`resume` | —                            | hold / continue                     |
| `seek`       | `{ position }`                   | jump within the DVR window          |
| `go_live`    | —                                | snap to the live edge               |
| `set_device` | `{ device_id }`                  | not implemented — returns 501       |
| `set_volume` | `{ gain }`                       | linear gain                         |

`position` is a `PlayoutPosition`: `{"kind":"live"}`,
`{"kind":"seq","value":123}`, or `{"kind":"seconds_behind_live","value":30}`.
A position outside the DVR window is clamped to `[dvr_start_seq, live_seq]`.

Because the playout head is part of `ServerState`, any seek immediately reshapes
the encoder's upload plan — e.g. seeking back 30 s makes the encoder protect
continuity around the new (earlier) head and stop upgrading near the old one.

### Live updates
```
WS /api/{stream}/ws  ->  stream of ControlEvent
```
`ControlEvent` is internally tagged by `"type"`; for the `Status` variant the
wrapped `ControlStatus` fields are flattened alongside the tag (not nested
under a `value` key) — e.g. `{"type":"status","stream":"obshow","server":{...},...}`.

Sent: a full `status` on connect and on every `ServerState` change (piggybacking
the same broadcast the SSE link-plane feed uses), `position` when the playout
head moves, and `meters` (`{vu_db_l, vu_db_r, ppm_db_l, ppm_db_r}`, dBFS, on a
fixed ~50ms tick). `ack` is defined in the schema for future use but not yet
sent — commands go through the plain HTTP response of `POST /api/{stream}/playout`
instead. The socket does not accept inbound commands; it is read-only from the
client's perspective.

`meters` carries two independently-computed ballistics per channel (L/R), both
fed from the actual post-gain playout audio callback (`obcast_proto::meter`),
meant to be superimposed on one meter widget per channel: `vu_db_{l,r}` is IEC
60268-17 "standard volume indicator" (VU) — symmetric attack/release, 300 ms
integration time, the slow "loudness" bar — and `ppm_db_{l,r}` is IEC 60268-10
Type I (DIN) peak programme meter — fast attack (5 ms burst reads 2 dB down,
per the standard's integration-time definition), slow decay (-20 dB in 1.5 s)
— a "flying PPM" peak needle that stays visible well after a transient has
passed. This reflects what the server is *actually playing out* right now;
the encoder client computes its own independent per-channel VU/PPM pairs from
the captured soundcard input for its own meters.

### Waveform
```
GET /api/{stream}/waveform?start_seq={seq}&end_seq={seq}
```
BBC waveform-data.js JSON (`version`/`channels`/`sample_rate`/`samples_per_pixel`/
`bits`/`length`/`data`), consumed directly by BBC's [peaks.js](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js)
on the web remote. `start_seq`/`end_seq` default to the current DVR window.
Extended with two obcast-specific parallel arrays peaks.js itself ignores:
`rungs` (best rung covering each point, `null` for a gap) and `seqs` (the DVR
seq each point belongs to) — together these let the client color-code the
waveform by quality without a second round trip. Computed by decoding every
segment in range via `ffmpeg` (mono, 8kHz, min/max per 40ms), so a request
over a multi-minute DVR window is not free — the web remote refreshes it on a
timer (every 5s), not per frame.

### Web remote (reference UI)
```
GET /remote/  ->  static single-page app (see web/remote/)
```
Talks to the REST + WS endpoints above, plus the waveform endpoint. It
exposes two independent audio paths and does not conflate them:
- **Server hardware output** — the real playout engine (§5), controlled by
  the buttons on the page and by clicking/dragging the peaks.js waveform.
  This is the position that feeds back into `ServerState` and reshapes the
  encoder's upload plan. Since there's no local audio to attach to,
  peaks.js runs against a custom `player` adapter (see
  [customizing.md](https://github.com/bbc/peaks.js/blob/master/doc/customizing.md))
  whose `seek()` posts to `POST /api/{stream}/playout` and whose notion of
  current time/playing state is a mirror of the WS `ControlEvent` stream —
  there is no real decode or playback happening in the browser for this path.
- **Listen-along preview** — a plain `hls.js` pull of `/hls/{stream}/master.m3u8`
  into a browser `<audio>` element, for checking levels/timing by ear. It has
  its own independent buffering and is not the playhead described above.

### Listener endpoints (HLS)
```
GET /hls/{stream}/master.m3u8
GET /hls/{stream}/{rendition}/index.m3u8     # sliding DVR window
GET /hls/{stream}/{rendition}/{seq}.ts
```

## 5. The closed loop, end to end

```
              (SSE state feed  +  piggyback on every upload response)
        ServerState  ─────────────────────────────────────────────►  encoder
        (head, frontier, lead, water, coverage)                         │
                                                                        ▼
                                                            plan_uploads(...)  ── tick
                                                                        │
   segment POSTs (rung, seq), idempotent, retryable   ◄────────────────┘
        │        priority: continuity ▸ live-edge ▸ upgrade(ahead-of-head only)
        ▼
     server ingest ▸ DVR store ▸ { HLS origin → listeners ; playout → HW out }
        ▲
   PlayoutCommand (start/seek/...) from web  ─── reshapes the head, hence the plan
```

**Scheduler tiers** (see `scheduler.rs`, all unit-tested):

1. **Continuity** — from the playout head forward, fill any hole at the **low
   rung** until `target_ms` of contiguous audio is secured. Allowed to burst past
   the tick budget; dropout is the worst outcome. When the buffer is draining on
   a flaky link, this is effectively "low quality first, no dropout."
2. **Live edge** — cover the newest ~`target_ms` at the low rung so the DVR stays
   contiguous and go-live is instant. Skipped in survival mode.
3. **Upgrade** — only when `lead_ms ≥ high_ms` and bandwidth remains, raise
   quality **strictly ahead of the playout head**, nearest-first, one rung step
   per tick. This is "add HD back in as speed recovers," and the ahead-of-head
   guard is what stops us upgrading segments that will never be played.

Continuity cost counts against the tick budget when gating tiers 2–3, so a
starved link spends everything on not-dropping and nothing on new/HD segments.
